# More Data More Problems

## How to Recreate NeurIPS 2023 Plots

For Folktables plots, see `notebooks/folktables-income-sandbox.ipynb`

For Yelp and MIMIC plots, see `run_dip.py --data {yelp, mimic}`

Note that `run_full_experiments.py` from the submission NeurIPS supplement code is the same as `run_dip.py`

## TODO
 - Create environment yaml for easier setup
